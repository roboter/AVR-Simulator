# TODO: Peripherals to Emulate

- [x] **EEPROM**: Implement register-based access (EECR, EEDR, EEAR) and persistence.
- [ ] **Timers**:
  - [x] Timer/Counter 0 (8-bit)
  - [ ] Timer/Counter 1 (16-bit)
  - [ ] Timer/Counter 2 (8-bit with PWM)
- [ ] **GPIO Enhancements**:
  - [ ] External Interrupts (INT0, INT1)
  - [ ] Pin Change Interrupts
- [x] **DAC**: Implement a virtual Digital-to-Analog Converter for extended simulation.
- [x] **UART**: Serial communication emulation.
- [ ] **SPI**: Serial Peripheral Interface emulation.
- [ ] **I2C/TWI**: Two-Wire Interface emulation.
- [ ] **Watchdog Timer**: Basic reset logic.
